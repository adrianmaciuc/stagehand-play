# ðŸ¤˜ Welcome to Stagehand!

Hey! This is a project built with [Stagehand](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand).

You can build your own web agent using: `npx create-browser-app`!

## Setting the Stage

Stagehand is an SDK for automating browsers. It's built on top of [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and provides a higher-level API for better debugging and AI fail-safes.

## Run tests

Run:

```bash
npm install && npx tsx tests/test1.ts
```

### Add your API keys

Required API keys/environment variables are in the `.env.` file.

Create a file called `.env` and add inside of it your Gemini API similar to this example : `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=SIzaS421BvsONNlJ4U14uvQOTF5ba-8oaxfgSaTMP8w`
